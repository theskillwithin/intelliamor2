## Current status
Theme is **ready to use** as Composer package with Magento 2.
Still a lot of things needs to be fixed or polished, but definietly it's working :smile:

## Installation
* `composer require snowdog/theme-blank-sass`
* If you are not in developer mode you should run `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy`
* Compile SASS files, i.e. via [Frontools](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/magento2-frontools)
* Check your great looking theme :wink:
